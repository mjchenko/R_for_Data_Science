#spread is 2p - 1
#where p is proportion of the sample

#if X = 1 for blue bead 0 for red bead
#if we add all the beads and take the average
#X_ = (X1 + X2 + ... + XN) / N which equals p
#distribution of N draws is N*X_ = X1 + X2 + ... + XN
#expected value E(X_) = p
#standard error of our estimate of X_ decreases as N increases
# SE(X_) = sqrt(p*(1-p)/N)

#expected value of sum of draws E(S) = Np
#standard error of sum of draws E(S) = sqrt(N*p*(1-p))
