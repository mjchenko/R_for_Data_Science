#two events are independent if the outcome of one does not affect the outcome
# of the other (for example: coin tosses)
# example of a dependent outcome would be dealing cards
# chances of getting a kind first time are 4/52 or 1 in 13.  After the first king is dealt
# chances you have another dealt to you are 3/51.

#when events are not independent conditional probabilities are needed
#written like this Pr(Card 2 is King | Card 1 is King) where | = "given that"

#if A and B are independent Pr(A | B) = Pr(A)

#multiplication rule for dependent events
# Pr(A and B) = Pr(A)Pr(B | A)
#ex Black Jack probability of getting 21 (ie ace, and then facecard or 10)
# Pr(A and B) = Pr(A)Pr(B | A) = 1/13 * (16/52)

# Pr(A and B and C) = Pr(A)Pr(B | A)Pr(C | A and B)

#for indenpendent events just multiply probabilities
#Pr(A and B and C) = Pr(A)Pr(B)Pr(C)
