#variance

# SD(Y | X = x) = sigma_y * sqrt(1-rho^2)
# Var(Y | X = X) = [SD(Y | X = x)]^2 = sigma_y^2 * (1-rho^2)


# In the statement "X explains such and such percent of the variability," 
# the percent value refers to the variance. The variance decreases by  rho^2  percent.


# The “variance explained” statement only makes sense when the data is 
# approximated by a bivariate normal distribution.
