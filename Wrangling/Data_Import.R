#### downloading files from the internet

# The read_csv() function and other import functions can read a URL directly.
# If you want to have a local copy of the file, you can use download.file().
# tempdir() creates a directory with a name that is very unlikely not to be unique.
# tempfile() creates a character string that is likely to be a unique filename.
